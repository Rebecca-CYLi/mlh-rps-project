## About

## Deploying on a webserver

Create `.env` files using the `.env.example` files as a template and set
the variables accordingly. Most variables have the sensible default
values but some need to be set explicitly:

    ```
    # flask.env
    SECRET_KEY

    # mongo.env
    MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME
    MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD
    MONGO_DB

    # nginx.env
    CERTBOT_EMAIL
    ```

If you do not already have the SSL certificates in `/etc/letsencrypt/`,
the Nginx container will automatically request them for you.

Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the app.

## Testing on localhost

Create `.env` files using the `.env.example` files as a template and set
the following variables:

    ```
    # nginx.env
    USE_LOCAL_CA=1
    DHPARAM_SIZE=512
    ```

Here, `DHPARAM_SIZE` is set to a low number to reduce the amount of time
it takes for the Nginx container to startup. In production, 2048 or
larger is
[recommended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange).

Next, change the following specifications in `docker-compose.yaml`:

    ```
    nginx:
        image: jonasal/nginx-certbot:dev
        volumes:
            - ./nginx-dev/user_conf.d:/etc/nginx/user_conf.d
    ```

Run `docker-compose up -d` and navigate to `https://localhost` once the
app has started up. Your browser will warn you of unrecognized
certificates: this is normal because the test configuration generates
[self-signed
certificates](https://github.com/JonasAlfredsson/docker-nginx-certbot/blob/master/docs/advanced_usage.md#local-ca).
Accept the warning in order to see the app.
